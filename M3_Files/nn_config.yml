# this yaml file contains essential parameters for training the neural network

# initial learning rate (can be tuned):
# the starting point for the learning rate scheduler
# a learning rate too high can lead to exploding or fluctuating loss
# a learning rate too low can lead to slow learning or overfitting
init_lr: 0.001

# batch size (can be tuned):
# a smaller batch size means the parameters are updated using a smaller subset of the data
# thus the parameter update will be more noisy, but the model may have better generalizability
batch_size: 100

# total number of epochs (can be tuned):
# when to stop the training
# a higher number of epochs can lead to overfitting
n_epochs: 50

# weight decay (can be tuned):
# adding a penalty to the cost which can lead to smaller model weights
weight_decay: 0.00001

# 3 categories (no changes needed): 
# coke = class 0, neither = class 1, sheep = class 2

# Two sets of network weights all kept during training (no changes needed):
#   the latest epoch (not necessarily the best),
#   and the best epoch evaluated against the evaluation metric.

# GPU option (no changes needed)
gpu_ids: '0'

# learning rate scheduler (can be tuned): 
# controls how fast the learning rate decreases
# here, the learning rate is designed to be its 50% every 5 epoch.
